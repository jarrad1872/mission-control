Jarrad works on features/frontend to branches.\n\n**Recent team change:** Robert Polo cut from team (no dev background, no domain expertise, redundant vibe coder role).\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n| Layer | Technology |\n|-------|------------|\n| Framework | Next.js 15.5.7, React 19.1.0, TypeScript 5 (strict) |\n| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4, Radix UI 2.x, Framer Motion |\n| Database | PostgreSQL (Neon serverless), Drizzle ORM 0.44 |\n| Auth | Better Auth v1.3.34 (cookie-based sessions) |\n| AI | Gemini 3 Pro (primary), OpenAI GPT-4 (fallback), Vercel AI SDK v5 |\n| Storage | Google Cloud Storage (GCS) |\n| Payments | Stripe 20.0 |\n| Notifications | Resend (email), Twilio (SMS), web-push |\n| Maps | Google Places API |\n| Background Jobs | Inngest |\n| State | Zustand |\n| Tables | TanStack Table + Virtual |\n| Testing | Vitest, Playwright |\n\n## Database\n\n- **67 tables** in `src/lib/db/schema.ts` (4,222 lines)\n- **Multi-tenant:** Every table has `companyId` foreign key\n- **7 repositories:** jobs, work-orders, resources, dispatch, inventory, resource-assignments, work-order-history\n\nKey tables:\n- companies, users, estimates, jobs, workOrders\n- plansets, people, equipment, tasks\n- customers, customerContacts\n- intakeItems (universal inbox)\n\n## Key Features\n\n### Work Order Management\n- **SmartWorkOrderCreator:** 5-step wizard (Customer → Job → Scope → Schedule → Review)\n- **Field App:** Clock in/out with GPS, task execution, photo documentation\n- **Review/Approval:** Office reviews completed work, adjusts quantities/hours\n\n### Planset Viewer (Bluebeam-style)\n- Measurement tools: length, area, perimeter, count\n- Markup tools: text, shapes, clouds, freehand\n- **AI scope detection:** Auto-detects work areas on construction plans\n- Scale detection: Automatically identifies drawing scales\n- Scope Builder: User-driven scope item creation with AI suggestions\n\n### Intake System (Universal Inbox)\n- Types: plansets, photos, documents, voice notes, text notes\n- AI categorization and routing\n- Conversion: intake → opportunity → estimate → job\n\n### Other Features\n- **Customer Portal:** Token-based access (no login), view work orders, e-sign documents\n- **Dispatch Board:** Live map, real-time crew tracking, route optimization\n- **Time & Payroll:** Time entry, overtime rules, PTO, payroll export\n- **Reporting:** Crew performance, profitability, AI-powered queries\n\n## AI Capabilities\n\n- **41 custom tools** in `src/lib/ai/tradeos-tools.ts`\n- Tool handlers in `tradeos-tool-handlers.ts`\n- AI scope detection on construction plans (bounding boxes, scale detection)\n- Contract analyzer\n- Intelligent router\n- Work type matcher\n- Estimate agent (50KB, main AI driver)\n\n## Architecture Patterns\n\n### Multi-Tenant\n```typescript\nconst { companyId, user } = await getCompanyContext(request);\n// All queries filter by companyId\n```\n\n### RBAC\n- **Roles:** owner, admin, manager, dispatcher, estimator, foreman, field_tech, office, viewer\n- **User Types (UI):** owner, admin, office, estimator, dispatcher, foreman, field_tech\n- Permission check: `hasPermission(user, 'estimates', 'create')`\n\n### File Storage (GCS Only)\n- Structure: `{companyId}/{category}/{uuid}.{ext}`\n- Categories: plansets, photos, documents, videos, intake, backups, migration\n- Always use signed URLs for uploads (direct to GCS, up to 200MB)\n\n## Development Workflow\n\nThe repo uses Claude Code with custom skills:\n- `/session-start` - Begin session, check tests\n- `/fix-issue` - Fix tracked issue (auto-tests before commit)\n- `/session-end` - End session, run full tests\n- `/status`, `/next` - Check state, get next task\n\nAgent-based development:\n- Main agent is \"conductor\" - doesn't write code\n- Delegates to sub-agents: Explore (haiku), Plan (opus), general-purpose (opus)\n- Context protection is priority\n\n## Open Issues (P0-P1)\n\n- **P0:** ~125 API routes need permission checks (scope-based permissions not enforced)\n- **P1:** No rate limiting on auth endpoints\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Deploy E2E workflow to production and test with real data\n2. Test full flow with Kippen Concrete team\n3. Have field techs test new activity buttons\n4. Verify SMS notifications\n5. Merge feature/e2e-workflow-overhaul to main\n",
